# Cypress Cucumber TypeScript Project

This repository contains a Cypress setup with Cucumber for BDD-style testing using TypeScript.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is designed for end-to-end (E2E) testing using **Cypress** and **Cucumber**, following the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach. 
It enables writing tests in a human-readable format while leveraging **TypeScript** for better maintainability.<br>
This project automates **form validation testing** using **Cypress, Cucumber, and TypeScript**. 
It ensures that form inputs behave correctly by verifying validations such as required fields, email format, password strength, and error messages.  
Using **Cucumber's BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) approach**, test scenarios are written in **Gherkin syntax**, making them easy to read and understand. 
**Cypress** provides fast and reliable test execution, while **TypeScript** enhances code maintainability and type safety.
